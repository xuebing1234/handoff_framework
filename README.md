This is the framework for machine learning prediction and interpretation for ICU medical data. 
I consolidated codes into three main files. 


preprocess : convert clinical variables using one-hot encoding, normalization, and dummy indicators


runner_file: perform machine learning training and validation using various ML algorithms


model interpretation: perform SHAP based model interpretation with visualizations illustrated in paper
